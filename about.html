    <h1>About...</h1>
    <h2>...me, the developer</h2>
    <p>Hello! I am just a dude from Latvia making silly projects in my spare time. Sometimes they are good, sometimes they are dumb, but one thing stays the same: all of them are driven by passion.</p>
    <h2>...the website itself</h2>
    <p>This website has been made to inform you nice folk of the cool stuff I am working on, as well as just experimenting with interesting ideas that require a website.</p>
    <h2>...my interests</h2>
    <p>If it is not obvious, programming and graphic design are up there. Oh, and video games! Those are neat, too. Long story short - if it is digital, I have probably messed around with it. Is that a good thing? Don't know.</p>
    <h2>Credits</h2>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/beandhd">Bean Man</a></strong> for being a huge help for my projects. Not much of actual help, but the moral support is more than enough. ‚ù§</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https:gensokyoradio.net">Gensokyo Radio</a></strong> for helping me stay sane, after all these years. Seriously, go check 'em out, even if you are not interested in that side of the internet.</p>
