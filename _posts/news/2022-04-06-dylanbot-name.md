Hello! Just wanted to inform ya regarding a little thing I have been procrastinating on doing. You see, I have worked on a little Discord bot for a friend of mine, and I have decided to do a little cool thing with it.

That requires a bit of an announcement, though.

I have finally decided that it is time to develop the bot **with the capability to work on ANY server.**

These are still the early days and I am still working hard on it. (When school is not throwing off my free time or I'm not busy procrastinating, that is.) But first, some of the obvious stuff.

This is a new chapter for this bot, as well as my general idea behind my projects. Starting from now, I want to try to make things for ANYONE on this cool little thing called the "Internet", and I think it's fitting the bot gets rebranded, as it is the only real *public* project. I'll start simple with a rebrand. The new name is...

# Dymuse.

### Why???
I have plenty of reasons. In short:
- **The bot was never intended to stay as "DylanBot".**
- **I never liked the name "DylanBot", as it was meant to be temporary.**
- **The name no longer reflects what the bot is now.**
- **It just sounds cooler, ok? :)**

If you are crazy enough to want to know more, feel free to check out [this page.](https://kortidev.notion.site/Version-History-28f0860a077745ab9bd57b3ce4c7f39b){:target="_blank"} Do note that it may be partially unfinished due to me being an amazing human being who is really good at definitely not procrastinating on anything and everything to the point where I may spend nearly a year to only start work on a thing I announced way back.

There's a lot in store for me and the bot, and I hope that any of this is at least mildly interesting.

See ya when I finish v3.0. Cheers! ðŸ‘‹
