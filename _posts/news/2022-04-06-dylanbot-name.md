The really inner circles of mine will know about the Discord bot I have written for myself and my friend's server. And for the really big spies (please go away), you will also know the bot has been getting less and less updates. Why is that, and why am I bringing it up here?

Because I have an announcement to make.

I have finally decided that it is time to develop the bot **with the capability to work on ANY server.**

These are still the early days and I am still working hard on it. But first, some of the obvious stuff.

## Name Change
**I am officially announcing that DylanBot is now going to go under the name of...**
# Dymuse.

### Why???
I have plenty of reasons. If you are too lazy and want the short version, here they are:
- **The bot was never intended to stay as "DylanBot".**
- **I never liked the name "DylanBot".**
- **The name no longer reflects what the bot is now.**
- **It just sounds cooler, ok?**

If you want to learn more lore about the Discord bot's name for *some reason*, feel free to check out [this Notion page.](https://kortidev.notion.site/Version-History-28f0860a077745ab9bd57b3ce4c7f39b){:target="_blank"} It is a Wikipedia of sorts.

For now, just the name will be the only thing I fully promise. When the update will drop, you will see what I have in store for ya. ;)

See ya when I finish v3.0! ðŸ‘‹
