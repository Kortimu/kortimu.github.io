I gladly welcome you to my own PERSONAL SITE! This place does not have much at the moment, but my plans are to update you with whatever I have been working on here. I might even write a blog with actually interesting material, who knows! The path up ahead is pretty long, and you should be excited to see what will happen!

My plans for the site:
- Keep you, the reader, up-to-date with all of my projects!
- Learn more about web development!
- ...that's it

Am I special? 

## No.

But I have the benefit of being overconfident!

I am pretty new to this, but I am learning fast, and you juuuuuuuuuust might not regret checking this place out. :)

## While you are waiting for actual content:
- If you want to waste your time, you can [check out my Twitter,](https://twitter.com/kortimu){:target="_blank"}. You won't waste your time because the content is dumb, you'll waste it because nothing's there.
- If for some reason you are like me and enjoy ~~stalking~~ checking out other people's code to learn, [here is my Github account.](https://github.com/Kortimu){:target="_blank"} My creations are too stupid to not be shared. It's that, or I just want someone to fix my stupid issues.

See ya until I actually have something to talk about! ðŸ‘‹
