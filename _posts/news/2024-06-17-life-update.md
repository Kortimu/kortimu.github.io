Oh, hi there. Didn't expect a visitor at this time of day. You know, some things have happened while you haven't been looking. A tiny change or two, nothing much.

Past me was an idiot. I'm no YouTuber. I'm yet to catch that disease. But I am starting to show symptoms. Like, *why did I add a news tab?* I'm not *that* cool. So I put that tab in a corner of shame, where it deserves to be. And, while that tab was in the corner, it hid away some things it was ashamed of. (You can still access them, and the link is the same. I may be ashamed, but I'm not going to hide what past me did. He deserves the shame.)

Am I anthromorphising a news button? Yes. You see, that is the second change. I have gone mad. I've actually finished the website. Sure, still jank, still with problems, but no longer incomplete. Good enough. Those changes include:
- brand new about page
- actual background
- projects page
- a slightly better mobile view
- a million tiny changes i have probably forgotten by now

Also, an actual blog post. Who knew I could actually make one of those? I didn't. Past me did, though. Thanks, past me.

That brings me to talk about the other stuff. School's quite a bastard, but I've got a slight strangle on it now. Going to the next school is scary, and might mean *even more* unwanted delays, but I won't be like past me and make false promises. I'll only brag about the things I've actually completed. If you care, check the website, like, once a month. Hell, check once a year and catch up to speed with the news tab. This time, there'll be less flaff and more fun.

By the way, while I was cleaning up the website, I decided to reshuffle the files so it both makes more sense and is neat and tidy. That also means that some images I'm no longer using for this website. However, since I am *already being such a pedant about "preserving history",* may as well show the now unused images here. Stuff's being kept archived on Github, so why not?

(Ok, this one *technically* is still used in an archived news post, but that's just because it was the default. Still a loss to society, so it counts.)

Yup, that's it. 1.5 years just for that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got some more projects in need of actual finishing. See you in 5 years.
