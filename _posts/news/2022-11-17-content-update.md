Oh wow, it's been a good while. Let me check... **OVER 7 MONTHS?!** Ok, yeah, this is not alright, it's time for me to do something about this.

First of all, an explanation.

## Le Why
tl;dr - burnout

As for the longer story, I had a vision for the website. What blog posts to write, what sections to have, what specials to make, all that good stuff. But I realized way too late that I just... did not enjoy writing them. The ideas were cool, the approach was interesting, I just... lost motivation. I did not enjoy writing that kind of content. I kept pushing and failing and pushing and failing and pushing and failing and... you get the point. I don't like working on multiple things at a time or scrapping projects, so I wanted the website to be finished before tackling the interesting stuff, no matter what.

But that led, to, uhh, this.

Yeah, sorry about that.

As you can see, I have finally picked up some momentum. I hope, at least. I'll try to be pretty honest here, and show what I have ROUGHLY planned in terms of quarters. These are plans, and I'll try to follow them, but stuff might happen.

## Le Plans
- **Q4 2022 -** I'll work on the website, as well as a little bit of a personal secret thingy.
- **Q1 2023 -** Nearing the end of it, I should have finally, **finally,** **FINALLY** finished the grand rebrand/rework/rewrite of my Discord bot.
- **Afterwards -** Not fully sure, but you might be surprised. üòâ

Once again, I apologize for being a terrible human being, and I'll see ya in 2026, when I remember about my projects once again.

Cheers! üëã
