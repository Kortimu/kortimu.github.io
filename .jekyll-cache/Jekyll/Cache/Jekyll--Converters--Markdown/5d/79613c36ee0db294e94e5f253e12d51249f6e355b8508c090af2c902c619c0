I"<p>That‚Äôs right. DylanBot is changing, and has needed a change for a loooooong time. On top of that, the original purpose of DylanBot is also changing, so it is time for a new fresh code of paint.</p>

<p>**I am officially announcing that DylanBot is now going to go under the name of‚Ä¶</p>
<h1 id="dymuse">Dymuse.</h1>

<h2 id="why">Why???</h2>
<p>I have plentiful of reasons. If you are too lazy and want the short version, here they are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The bot was never intended to stay as ‚ÄúDylanBot‚Äù.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>I never liked the name ‚ÄúDylanBot‚Äù.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>The name no longer reflects what the bot is now.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>It just sounds cooler, ok?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>For those that want the long version, get some popcorn and PREPARE.</p>

<p>‚Ä¶just kidding. If you want the whole history and how it fits in with everything, check out <a href="https://kortidev.notion.site/Version-History-28f0860a077745ab9bd57b3ce4c7f39b" target="_blank">this Notion page.</a> If you want the somewhat shorter story, here it is.</p>

<h2 id="the-history">The History</h2>
<p>From the inception, my Discord bot was made for a friend as a fun project. In the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v1.x</code> days, it was just a silly project (kinda still is, lol). But with time, I have noticed how the bot is only getting closer and closer to being a fully fledget legitimate Discord bot which can be used in other servers.</p>

<p>W o a h.</p>
