I"y<p>The really inner circles of mine will know about the Discord bot I have written for myself and my friend’s server. And for the really big spies (please go away), you will also know the bot has been getting less and less updates. Why is that, and why am I bringint it up here?</p>

<p>Because I have an announcement to make.</p>

<p><strong>I am officially announcing that DylanBot is now going to go under the name of…</strong></p>
<h1 id="dymuse">Dymuse.</h1>

<p>I have plentiful of reasons. If you are too lazy and want the short version, here they are:</p>

But with time, I have noticed how the bot is only getting closer and closer to being a fully fledget legitimate Discord bot which can be used in other servers.</p>

<p>W o a h.</p>
