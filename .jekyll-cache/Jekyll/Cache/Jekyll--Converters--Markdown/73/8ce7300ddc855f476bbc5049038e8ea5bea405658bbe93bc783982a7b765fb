I"­<p>I gladly welcome you to my own PERSONAL SITE! This place does not have much at the moment, but my plans are to update you with whatever I have been working on here. I might even write a blog with actually interesting material, who knows! The path up ahead is pretty long, and you should be excited to see what will happen!</p>

<p>My plans for the site:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Keep you, the reader, up-to-date with all of my projects!</li>
  <li>Learn more about web development!</li>
  <li>â€¦thatâ€™s it</li>
</ul>

<p>Am I special?</p>

<h2 id="no">No.</h2>

<p>But I have the benefit of being overconfident!</p>

<p>I am pretty new to this, but I am learning fast, and you juuuuuuuuuust might not regret checking this place out. :)</p>

<h3 id="while-you-are-waiting-for-actual-content">While you are waiting for actual content:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If you want to waste your time, you can <a href="https://twitter.com/kortimu" target="_blank">check out my Twitter,</a>. You wonâ€™t waste your time because the content is dumb, youâ€™ll waste it because nothingâ€™s there.</li>
  <li>If for some reason you are like me and enjoy <del>stalking</del> checking out other peopleâ€™s code to learn, <a href="https://github.com/Kortimu" target="_blank">here is my Github account.</a> My creations are too stupid to not be shared. That, or I just want someone to fix my stupid issues.</li>
</ul>

<p>See ya until I actually have something to talk about! ðŸ‘‹â€™</p>
